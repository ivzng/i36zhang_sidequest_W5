## Description

This project is a side-scrolling platformer built with p5.js using a modular game structure (player, camera, platforms, and JSON-based level data). The game was extended with a Geometry Dash-inspired auto-panning mechanic, where the screen begins scrolling once the player starts moving and speeds up over time. If the player falls behind and touches the left edge of the screen, they lose and respawn.

The level was also expanded with additional platforms and a more challenging progression, including larger gaps and smaller landing areas to increase difficulty as the player advances.

## Learning Goals

- Create a camera-driven experience in a world larger than the screen
- Use pacing and motion to evoke mood and emotional change
- Explore how scrolling speed affects player perception and tension
- Work with modular game systems (player, camera, world, platforms)
- Use JSON-based level data to scale and shape the environment
- Implement time-based motion using deltaTime
- Iterate on camera feel and level layout through testing and tuning
